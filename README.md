# tictactoe

A tic-tac-toe game for you to play with another player! 
I would like to come back to it to make future updates such as creating an AI for the game and updating the game board display to provide a better player experience. 
At the moment, it is a simple tic-tac-toe game that allows you to play with a friend. Simply enter in your names if you desire, and be the first to get 3 of your pieces in consecutively together!
